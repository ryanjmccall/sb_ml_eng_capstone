    "The goal of this step is to find a machine learning or deep learning approach that works for your problem, and then show that the approach you choose is a viable one. Since the application has not been deployed to production yet, we’ll call it a prototype.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this step, you’ll build your prototype in a Jupyter notebook. Depending on your problem, you’ll be using a more ‘traditional’ machine learning (ML) technique or a deep learning (DL) technique. Your goal is to come up with a working implementation of your prototype in a Jupyter notebook. This prototype could work on a subset of the data but demonstrates that your approach to solving the problem is a viable one based on the following criteria:\n",
    "- The data has been reasonably split into training, validation, and test sets.\n",
    "- You have used the correct metric(s) to evaluate the performance of your\n",
    "algorithm.\n",
    "- The performance of your algorithm is ‘good enough’ as determined by your mentor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "- The submission shows that the student understands how to design, implement, and justify a suitable machine learning and/or deep learning approach to a problem.\n",
    "- The submission demonstrates that the student made thoughtful decisions about validating and testing the approach:\n",
    "    - The data has been reasonably split into training, validation, and test sets\n",
    "    - The ML/DL algorithm chosen for the approach makes sense in the context of the problem\n",
    "    - The student has used the correct metric(s) to evaluate the performance of their algorithm\n",
    "    - The performance of their algorithm is ‘good enough’ to meet the requirements of the business problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- Well-documented GitHub repository and code. The Jupyter notebooks for the code provide step-by-step documentation that’s easy to follow. "
